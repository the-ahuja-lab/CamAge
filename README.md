<div align="center"><b>An Image-based Intelligent Lens for single-cell Age Prediction and its Aging-associated Bioactivities</b></div><br><br>
An advanced transfer learning framework utilizing spatiotemporal information from phase-contrast images to predict yeast cell age at single-cell resolution. In addition, CamAge integrates predictive models for various aging-related biological processes, such as genomic instability, reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial content, and potential, among others, and also calculates cellular morphometric parameters.
